# A repo with exercices for the "Recherche information web" course. 

Uses [plot](github.com/gonum/plot) to draw the required plots and [porter2](github.com/zhenjl/porter2) for stemming.
[Snappy](https://google.github.io/snappy/) is used to improve the size of the encoded indexes.

A working version of the code is available [here](https://riw.succo.fr).
